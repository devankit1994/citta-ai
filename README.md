# Application Setup & Usage Guide

This project is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will start, and the terminal will display a local development URL (typically `http://localhost:5173/`).

## Navigating the Application

Once the development server is running, open your browser and go to the local URL shown in the terminal.

You can access the following routes:

- **Active Teams and Groups**

  - URL: `http://localhost:5173/active-teams-and-groups`
  - Displays the Active Teams and Groups page.

- **Agents and Connectors**
  - URL: `http://localhost:5173/agents-and-connectors`
  - Displays the Agents and Connectors page.

You can navigate to these routes by entering the URLs directly in your browser's address bar or by using any in-app navigation provided.
